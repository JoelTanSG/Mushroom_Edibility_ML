# Mushroom_Edibility_ML
Train a model to tell if a mushroom is poisonous or edible
## Description
This project is using data from the Audobon Society Field Guide. 
Downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom) or it can be gotten directly from the respository. 
The two data files used are:
1. agarious-lepiota.data
2. agarious-lepiota.names
## General Steps Taken
1. Downloading and cleaning the data
2. Perform short analysis of the data
3. Using machine learning techniques to train a model to predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible
4. Creating a decision tree and visualize it
## Credits
This is a guided project by the wonderful team at: [UpLevel](https://dataprojects.uplevel.work/)
